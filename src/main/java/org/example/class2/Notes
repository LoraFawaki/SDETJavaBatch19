String: "it is a text"
String is a non-primitive data type that is used to store multiple characters in a variable.

String Concatenation: "combining together"
String concatenation allows us to join two strings together.
Primitive data types starts with "lowercase" (byte)
non-primitive data types starts with "Uppercase" (String)
+" "+ to add a space between strings.
We create a Variable, when we need to reuse something multiple times.
Computers can't see multiple things at a time. a Computer can see one instruction at a time,
and it executes orders line by line.
Once we Concatenate, One of the variables has to be a string. we can concatenate numbers(int or double)
within one string.
Ctrl+D will duplicate the line.
+ symbol use changes depending on the data type. if + is used with Strings or with different variable types which one is text,
it will combine texts. if + is used with number data types "int, long, or double" it will perform an addition.
 + symbol doesn't work with boolean.
symbols are called "Operators" in Java.
