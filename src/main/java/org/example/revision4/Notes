Loops:
  Loops help us repeat a block of code until condition is fails. There are 4 main types of loops in Java.

  1- While Loop
  2- Do While Loop
  3- For Loop
  4- Enhanced For Loop

  While Loop:
      When we don't know the number of iterations beforehand,while loop is the best
      type of loop to use in the scenario - example: searching for a product from Amazon
      when we use the while loop, we can keep clicking on the next button till we find it,
      because while accepts boolean.

  Do While Loop:
     When we want to execute the body of the loop at least once before we check the condition
     that is when we use Do While Loop.
     Do While is best loop to use with Scanner.
     used for forms as well.

  For Loop:
     For Loop is a better choice when we know the number of iteration in advance.
     example: we want to print 10 numbers.
        if I am searching a product on Amazon and I want to see ONLY the first 10 matching products.
        if I am searching for a specific product with a specific price (Eyeliner for 20$)

  Enhanced For Loop:
     It is a simplified version of normal for loop where the elements are pulled from the array automatically
     one by one. There is no index involved in this type of loop.
     it is limited, can't be used to skip elements or reverse directions.
     We should use it whenever possible.

  Arrays:
     Array is a collection of multiple variables. Every variable is given a number called (index) to help us retrieve
     and store data inside the array.
  Why should we use Arrays:
     When we have a lot of data storing it inside variables, save time and resources

   Syntax:
   approach 1 (to create empty array):
        DataType [] ArrayName= new DataType[size];
        int [] number = new int[5]

   approach 2 (when we know the variables):
        DataType [] ArrayName={ element1, element2, element3, ......}
        int [] numbers={10,20,30,40,....};

   Nested Loops:
      Nested Loop is a loop inside another loop
