Scanner Class in Java:
        Scanner is a class just like the classes that we create,
        but it is specially designed so that others can use it.
        This calls has a lot of methods which can hep us take the input from the keyboard "next.int -
        next.double - next.line....."

we use "switch" when we are checking the same variable against multiple values and for each value we
want to do something different

Logical Operators:
  help us to combine multiple conditions.
  There are 3 logical operators in Java.
  They only work with boolean data types
  1- AND (&&)
  helps us to combine
  2- OR (||)
  Logical Or helps us to combine multiple boolean conditions in a way
  that when  one condition is true the overall result is tru
  3- NOT (!)
  Reverses the conditions of something is true it will be false and vice versa

Loops:
  help us execute a block of code as long as a condition is true
  repeat a piece/block of code again and again
Why should we use loops?
  Loops help us reduce duplicate code for us
in Java there are 5 types of loops
1- while
2-do While
3- for

When we should use the while loop:
   when we don't know the number of iterantions in advance, it is better we use while loop.
